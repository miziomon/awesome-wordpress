## Core

* [WordPress on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress) - WordPress, Git-ified. Synced via SVN every 15 minutes, including branches and tags!
* [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/) - The purpose of the WordPress Coding Standards is to create a baseline for collaboration and review within various aspects of the WordPress open source project and community, from core code to themes to plugins.
* [The Customizer API](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/customizer-api/) - The Customizer is a framework for live-previewing any change to WordPress. It provides a simple and consistent interface for users to customize various aspects of their theme and their site, from colors and layouts to widgets, menus, and more. Themes and plugins alike can add custom options to the Customizer. The Customizer is the canonical way to add options to your theme.
* [Automated Testing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/automated-testing/) - This is an overview of running and writing tests for WordPress. Automated testing is running test cases where manual intervention is not required to run each one. This is usually in the form of writing test suites which have multiple test cases and a library and command line tool that runs the test suite or suites. The test suite execution is usually manual, from the developer choosing which suites on the command line to run, but this isnâ€™t required. The process could be automated and looked over from time to time to ensure that when the code changed, no problems were introduced.

	
## Themes and Framework

* [_S](https://github.com/automattic/_s) - Hi. I'm a starter theme called _s, or underscores, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.
